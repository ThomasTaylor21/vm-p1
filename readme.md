 ##MVP: 
	 Point and click to images brought in via NASA api. 
	 Choices will be selectable via indexed buttons that will expand to an assortment of images that will appear for viewing.

	 Point and click
	 Selectable list from a drop-down list of images
	 Return of image (one at a time) Can cycle through using a reset or clearing the image panel.

##Post-MVP: 

	 Add a method to print image to local printer
	 Add a method to :share image: or send via email.
	 Add method to save image to you device (PC or Smartphone
	
## Goals: What you plan to accomplish for each day of the project week.

Day 1
		 Connect and import API to my GitHUB Repository: https://github.com/ThomasTaylor21/vm-p1#:~:text=/-,vm-p1,-Public
		 Configure Base of Website: HTML, CSS & JavaScript
		 Focus on HTML structure, Test as I move along 
		
Day 2
		§ Focus on JavaScript and integrate to HTML
		§ Testing the API connectivity and addressing issues
		§ Start refining with Front end User GUI by setting up CSS
		§ Testing only one API for get format and structures correct.
		§ Duplicating tested API with other two APIs
		
DAY 3
		§ Adding more features to front end GUI model
		§ Include "reset" feature and "drop-down selector
		§ Refine for eye appeal
		
DAY 4
		Test site and have support take a look at progress and inquire for any refinement of site
		
DAY 5
		Continue to streamline front-end page by looking for opportunities to improve code: CLEAN-UP
		
DAY 6
