	• Wireframes: The proposed layout and design of your app. Create mockups for your views. If your are creating multiple views including both desktop and mobile formats, and consider whether or not you need to account for landscape and portrait orientations. Please use a digital tool to complete your wireframe.

	• MVP: 
		○ Point and click to images brought in via NASA api. Choices will be selectable via indexed buttons that will expand to an assortment of images that will appear for viewing.
	• 
	• A list of features you will need to build in order to meet the Minimum Viable Product. This will be the rubric your project will be graded against.
		○ Point and click
		○ Selectable list from a drop-down list of images
		○ Return of image (one at a time) Can cycle through using a reset or clearing the image panel.
	• Post-MVP: A list of additional/advanced features you would like to include in your app after you have met MVP.
		○ Add a method to print image to local printer
		○ Add a method to :share image: or send via email.
		○ Add method to save image to you device (PC or Smartphone
		
	• Goals: What you plan to accomplish for each day of the project week.
		○ Day 1
			§ Connect and import API to my GitHUB Repository: https://github.com/ThomasTaylor21/vm-p1#:~:text=/-,vm-p1,-Public
			§ Configure Base of Website: HTML, CSS & JavaScript
			§ Focus on HTML structure, Test as I move along
		○ Day 2
			§ Focus on JavaScript and integrate to HTML
			§ Testing the API connectivity and addressing issues
			§ Start refining with Front end User GUI by setting up CSS
			§ Testing only one API for get format and structures correct.
			§ Duplicating tested API with other two APIs
		○ DAY 3
			§ Adding more features to front end GUI model
			§ Include "reset" feature and "drop-down selector
			§ Refine for eye appeal
		○ DAY 4
			§ Test site and have support take a look at progress and inquire for any refinement of site
			§ Continue to streamline front-end page by looking for opportunities to improve code: CLEAN-UP
			
		



	• Priority Matrix: A graph of your intended areas of development (Pseudocoding, Design, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Testing, etc) plotted on an X/Y axis where X represents time to completion and Y represents priority. Use a professional tool or upload a well drawn image using an image hosting site such as Cloudinary or a similar hosting service.




	• Timeframes: How long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day. Components should be broken down into a maximum of 3 hours time blocks.
